### Yabe Webfont: the #1 Self-hosted Google Fonts and Custom Fonts Manager for WordPress

### FEATURES

Yabe Webfont is packed full of features designed to streamline your workflow. Some of our favorites are:

* **Custom Fonts**: A dedicated custom fonts manager for WordPress. The central place to manage all your fonts and typography.
* **Easy to use**: Add custom fonts to your WordPress site with a simple and intuitive interface. No coding knowledge is needed. You can upload the font files using the WordPress media uploader. No FTP is required.
* **Fine-tuning**: Complete control over your fonts and typography. On 90% of use cases, the default one is good to go.
* **Lightweight and blazingly fast**: The font management system uses WordPress REST API and a modern JavaScript framework for an instant, responsive user experience. The front page cache ensures fast loading and reduces database queries.
* **Variable Fonts support**: The format allows a single font file to contain multiple stylistic variations.
* **Multisite support**: The plugin is compatible with WordPress Multisite (Activate the plugin on the site level).
